Major cities include New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston. The country operates under a federal government system with a President, who serves as both head of state and government.

You: what is langchain
AI: LangChain is a framework designed to aid in creating applications that integrate with large language models (LLMs). It provides a suite of tools and components that simplify the development process for applications like chatbots, question-answering systems, and other AI-driven tools. LangChain is particularly useful for:

1. **Prompt Management**: Assisting developers in constructing and managing prompts for LLMs effectively.
   
2. **Chains**: Enabling sequences of calls to LLMs or other utilities, allowing more complex and context-aware interactions.
   
3. **Agents**: Facilitating dynamic calls to LLMs that can make decisions about which action to take next, which can be useful for tasks like data retrieval or interacting with APIs.
   
4. **Memory**: Allowing the storage and retrieval of information across interactions, which is essential for maintaining context in conversations.

5. **Integration**: Providing tools to easily integrate with other data sources and APIs, making it adaptable for various applications and workflows.

By using LangChain, developers can focus on higher-level logic and leverage the power of language models more effectively in their applications.
